# Inception

<p>This project aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker. You will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in your new personal virtual machine.</p>


##### Docker

Containerization is a very good and efficient alternative to VMs for development environments
Containers are much more lightweight than VMs, thus much faster to start and stop.
The inconvinience of containers is that they sit on top of your OS. Unlike virtual machines, they don’t emulate the hardware, but rather share your machine’s hardware. We won’t go into the details of how containerization works, but to keep it simple, that means that if you run MacOS, it is not possible to run a Linux or Windows container. (Docker makes it work using VMs).
